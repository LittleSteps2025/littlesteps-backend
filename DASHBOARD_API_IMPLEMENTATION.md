## Database Schema Used

### Tables Queried:
1. **child** - For total children count
2. **user** - For parents, teachers, supervisors count
3. **payments** - For monthly revenue calculation
4. **attendance** - For today's check-ins (optional)
5. **complaint** - For recent complaint activities
6. **announcement** - For recent announcement activities

## SQL Queries Executed

### Total Children
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM child
```

### Active Parents
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT email) as count 
FROM "user" 
WHERE role = 'parent'
```

### Active Teachers
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as count 
FROM "user" 
WHERE role = 'teacher'
```

### Active Supervisors
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as count 
FROM "user" 
WHERE role = 'supervisor'
```

### Today's Check-ins
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as count 
FROM attendance 
WHERE DATE(check_in_time) = CURRENT_DATE
```

### Monthly Revenue
```sql
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0) as total 
FROM payments 
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at) = EXTRACT(MONTH FROM CURRENT_DATE)
AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE)
AND (status = 'completed' OR paid_at IS NOT NULL)
```

### Recent Activities (Union Query)
```sql
(
  SELECT 
    p.id as activity_id,
    p.parent_email as user_id,
    u.name as user_name,
    'made payment' as activity_type,
    'payment' as type,
    p.created_at as timestamp,
    CONCAT('Payment of LKR ', p.amount::text) as description
  FROM payments p
  LEFT JOIN "user" u ON p.parent_email = u.email
  WHERE p.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
)
UNION ALL
(
  SELECT 
    c.complaint_id as activity_id,
    c.parent_email as user_id,
    u.name as user_name,
    'submitted complaint' as activity_type,
    'complaint' as type,
    c.created_at as timestamp,
    c.complaint_type as description
  FROM complaint c
  LEFT JOIN "user" u ON c.parent_email = u.email
  WHERE c.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
)
UNION ALL
(
  SELECT 
    a.ann_id as activity_id,
    a.user_id::text as user_id,
    u.name as user_name,
    'created announcement' as activity_type,
    'announcement' as type,
    a.created_at as timestamp,
    a.title as description
  FROM announcement a
  LEFT JOIN "user" u ON a.user_id = u.user_id
  WHERE a.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
)
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT ?
```

## Frontend Integration

The frontend is already configured to:
1. ✅ Fetch data on mount
2. ✅ Display loading states
3. ✅ Show error messages
4. ✅ Format time ago for activities
5. ✅ Refresh data on button click
6. ✅ Handle authentication

### Example Frontend Call:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5001/api/admin/dashboard/stats', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
const data = await response.json();
```

## Testing the API

### Using cURL

**Get Statistics:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5001/api/admin/dashboard/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Get Activities:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5001/api/admin/dashboard/activities?limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Using Postman
1. Method: GET
2. URL: `http://localhost:5001/api/admin/dashboard/stats`
3. Headers:
   - `Authorization`: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`
   - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
4. Send

## Error Handling

The API handles:
- ✅ Missing authentication tokens (401)
- ✅ Database connection errors (500)
- ✅ Missing tables (returns 0 or empty array)
- ✅ Invalid queries (logged and returns error)

## Server Status

✅ Server is running on port 5001
✅ Routes registered successfully
✅ Database connections working
✅ All endpoints accessible

## Optional: Add created_at Column

If you want to track when children are registered, run:
```bash
node addCreatedAtColumn.js
```

This will add `created_at` columns to:
- `child` table
- `complaint` table (if not exists)

## What's Working

1. ✅ Dashboard statistics from real database
2. ✅ Recent activities from multiple tables
3. ✅ Proper error handling
4. ✅ Authentication support
5. ✅ Time-based filtering (last 7 days)
6. ✅ Configurable activity limit
7. ✅ Union queries for multiple sources
8. ✅ NULL-safe operations

## Navigation Ready

The dashboard supports navigation to:
- `/admin/children` - Total children card
- `/admin/parents` - Active parents card
- `/admin/users` - Teachers card
- `/admin/attendance` - Check-ins card
- `/admin/payments` - Revenue card
- `/admin/announcements` - Quick action
- `/admin/complaints` - Quick action
- `/admin/reports` - Quick action
- `/admin/activities` - View all activities

## Next Steps

1. Test the endpoints in your frontend
2. Verify the data matches your database
3. Optionally run the migration script for created_at
4. Check that activities show up correctly
5. Verify authentication is working

## Support

The backend is now fully operational. If you see any issues:
1. Check the server console for errors
2. Verify your database tables exist
3. Ensure authentication tokens are valid
4. Check that CORS is configured properly

**Server URL:** http://localhost:5001
**Status:** ✅ Running
**Endpoints:** ✅ Ready
**Database:** ✅ Connected
