# Dashboard Check-in Update - Report Table Integration

## Summary of Changes

The dashboard's "Today's Check-ins" feature has been updated to count new entries from the `report` table instead of the `attendance` table.

## What Changed

### 1. Today's Check-ins Logic

**Previous Implementation:**
- Counted entries from `attendance` table
- Query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM attendance WHERE DATE(check_in_time) = CURRENT_DATE`

**New Implementation:**
- Counts entries from `report` table
- Query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM report WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE`

### 2. Recent Activities Enhancement

Added report submissions to the recent activities feed:
- Shows when teachers submit reports
- Displays teacher name and child ID
- Activity type: "submitted report"
- Appears in chronological order with other activities

## Database Requirements

### Report Table Schema Expected

```sql
CREATE TABLE report (
  report_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  child_id INTEGER,
  teacher_id INTEGER,
  create_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  -- other report fields...
);
```

Required columns:
- `report_id` - Unique identifier
- `child_id` - Reference to child
- `teacher_id` - Reference to teacher who created report
- `create_date` - Timestamp when report was created (NOTE: uses create_date not created_at)

## API Response

### Dashboard Stats

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Dashboard statistics retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "totalChildren": 45,
    "activeParents": 38,
    "activeTeachers": 12,
    "activeSupervisors": 5,
    "todayCheckIns": 8,  // ← Counts reports created today
    "monthlyRevenue": 275000
  }
}
```

### Recent Activities (New Type Added)

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Recent activities retrieved successfully",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "activity_id": 123,
      "user_id": "456",
      "user": "Teacher Name",
      "user_name": "Teacher Name",
      "action": "submitted report",
      "activity_type": "submitted report",
      "type": "report",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-17T08:30:00Z",
      "description": "Report submitted for child ID: 5"
    },
    // ... other activities
  ]
}
```

## SQL Queries

### Today's Check-ins

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as count 
FROM report 
WHERE DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE
```

### Recent Report Activities

```sql
SELECT 
  r.report_id as activity_id,
  r.teacher_id::text as user_id,
  t.name as user_name,
  'submitted report' as activity_type,
  'report' as type,
  r.created_at as timestamp,
  CONCAT('Report submitted for child ID: ', r.child_id::text) as description
FROM report r
LEFT JOIN "user" t ON r.teacher_id = t.user_id
WHERE r.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
```

## How It Works

### Check-in Flow

1. Teacher creates a new report for a child
2. New entry is added to `report` table with `created_at = NOW()`
3. Dashboard's "Today's Check-ins" counter increases by 1
4. Activity appears in recent activities feed
5. Count resets at midnight (only shows today's date)

### Activity Types Now Tracked

1. **Report Submissions** ← NEW
   - Type: "report"
   - Action: "submitted report"
   - Shows: Teacher name and child ID

2. **Payments**
   - Type: "payment"
   - Action: "made payment"
   - Shows: Payment amount

3. **Complaints**
   - Type: "complaint"
   - Action: "submitted complaint"
   - Shows: Complaint type

4. **Announcements**
   - Type: "announcement"
   - Action: "created announcement"
   - Shows: Announcement title

5. **Child Registrations**
   - Type: "registration"
   - Action: "registered child"
   - Shows: Child name

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Morning Reports
```
8:00 AM - Teacher A submits report for Child 1
8:30 AM - Teacher B submits report for Child 2
9:00 AM - Teacher A submits report for Child 3

Dashboard shows:
- Today's Check-ins: 3
- Recent Activities: 
  * Teacher A submitted report (9:00 AM)
  * Teacher B submitted report (8:30 AM)
  * Teacher A submitted report (8:00 AM)
```

### Scenario 2: Throughout the Day
```
Morning:  5 reports submitted → Check-ins: 5
Afternoon: 3 reports submitted → Check-ins: 8
Evening:   2 reports submitted → Check-ins: 10

At midnight, counter resets to 0 for the next day.
```

## Frontend Display

### Stats Card
```
Today's Check-ins
       10
   [📊 Card]
```

### Recent Activities
```
Recent Activity
├─ Teacher Name submitted report - 5 min ago
├─ Parent Name made payment - 10 min ago
├─ Teacher Name submitted report - 15 min ago
└─ Admin created announcement - 20 min ago
```

## Error Handling

If the `report` table doesn't exist or query fails:
- Returns `0` for today's check-ins
- Logs error to console
- Doesn't break the dashboard
- Other stats continue to work

## Testing

### Manual Test

1. Create a new report entry:
```sql
INSERT INTO report (child_id, teacher_id, created_at)
VALUES (5, 14, NOW());
```

2. Call the stats API:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5001/api/admin/dashboard/stats
```

3. Verify `todayCheckIns` increased by 1

4. Call activities API:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:5001/api/admin/dashboard/activities?limit=10"
```

5. Verify report submission appears in activities

## Benefits

✅ Real-time check-in tracking based on actual reports
✅ Accurate count of daily activity
✅ Teachers' work is visible in dashboard
✅ Better insight into daily operations
✅ Automatic reset at midnight
✅ Integrated with activity feed

## Migration Note

If you're upgrading from the old system:
- No data migration needed
- Old attendance data remains unchanged
- Dashboard immediately uses report table
- Backward compatible (fails gracefully if table missing)

## Server Status

✅ Server running on port 5001
✅ Updated dashboard model deployed
✅ API endpoints working
✅ Report-based check-ins active
